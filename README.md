# Andrew's store endpoints

## Build with
### Flask Web framework 
This framework was used because it provides simplicity and flexibility control. it lets you decide how you want to implement things

## Version
Version 1

## Installation
Clone this repository
```
- git clone https://github.com/Njaya2019/storemanager-endpoints/tree/developer
```
Go into the repository
```
- cd developer
```

Install project dependencies
```
- pip install flask
- pip install pytest
```

Start the app
```
- python application.py
```
### URL requests
Use postman to test all these endpoints

| url                       | http method   | function         |
| ------------------------  | ------------- | ---------------- |
| api/v1/admin/products     | POST          | Store a product  |
| api/v1/admin/products     | GET           | View all products|

| api/v1/admin/sales        | GET           | View all sales   |


 
## Tests
These tests `test` all endpoints.They test a response code and the data being sent along. The tests used pytest framework because it is easy to write small tests yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications,gives detail infomation on failing assert statements auto discovery of test modules and functions.

The `example` below tests an endpoint that returns a status code 404 and message the server could not find what was requested.

```python

def test_get_sale_no_record(cli_ent):
    response=cli_ent.get('/api/v1/admin/sales/'+str(2))
    data=json.loads(response.data)
    assert response.status_code==404
    assert 'The sale record wasn\'t found' in data["message"]

```

How to run the tests.
```
- Run the tests
  - py.test -vv

```
